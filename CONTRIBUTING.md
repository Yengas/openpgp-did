# Contributing to OpenPGP-DID

First off, thank you for considering contributing to OpenPGP-DID. 

## 1. Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## 2. Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```shell
git checkout -b feat/325-add-japanese-translations
```

## 3. Code

Here's the most important part: Write your code. Enjoy it!

## 4. Submit a pull request

Ready to submit your code? Push your branch to your fork repository on GitHub and then press the “New pull request” button on your repo page.

## 5. Be ready for feedback

The OpenPGP-DID project maintainers will review your code and might provide some constructive criticism. They appreciate you contributing and will try their best to enable you to get your code into the project.
